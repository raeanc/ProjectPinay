  <h2> WHO ARE WE? </h3>
    <p>Project Pinay is a self-initiated overseas Values-In-Action (VIA) 
      project under Rotaract Club of Singapore that focuses on educating youths 
      in the Philippines on sexual education and puberty.

    <div class ="box">
<h3> OUR MISSION </h3>
  <p>To educate and empower Filipino youths by providing accessible sexual education, puberty awareness, 
    and menstrual hygiene knowledge through interactive lessons and community engagement. Founded in 2021, the project 
      has since been continued by successive teams and is currently in its fifth edition.
Through physical lessons and interactive games, we hope to introduce the concept of 
      sexual education and puberty in a light-hearted manner such that youths are able to 
      better understand and be receptive to such sensitive</p>

  <h3>WHY "PINAY"?</h3>
    <p>The term “Pinay”, which is a colloquial term used to refer to a Filipino woman or girl. celebrates Filipino girls and women, 
      reflecting our focus on empowering them through education, awareness, and advocacy.” </p>
  <div class= "box">
     <h3>WHY THE PHILIPPINES?</h3>
    <p>
- Teenage pregnancy in the Philippines remains alarmingly high, with UNFPA echoing NEDA and POPCOM in describing it as a “national emergency.” 
      <br> 
- Limited sexual education, with only 28% of Filipino adolescents having access to comprehensive sexuality education in schools according to the UNFPA.
<br>
- According to Plan International, many young Filipino girls lack access to proper menstrual products, with surveys showing 
      around 30% of schoolgirls miss classes due to period-related issues.
      <br>
     THE TL:DR? The Philippines has high teenage pregnancy rates, limited sexual education, 
      and menstrual hygiene challenges. Project Pinay solves this by focusing on empowering Filipino girls 
      through education and awareness.
